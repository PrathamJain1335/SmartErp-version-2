## 🔧 Technical Features

### **ERP-Specific Intelligence**
```javascript
// Only responds to queries containing ERP keywords:
'student', 'faculty', 'admin', 'attendance', 'grades', 
'courses', 'portal', 'dashboard', 'profile', etc.
```

### **Smart Navigation**
- **Portal Navigation**: "Open student portal" → Redirects to /student
- **Section Navigation**: "Show attendance" → Opens attendance tab
- **Context Awareness**: Knows current user role and portal

### **Query Examples That Work**:
✅ "How do I check my attendance?"
✅ "Open faculty portal"
✅ "Navigate to grades section"
✅ "Show me student management features"
✅ "How to enter marks for students?"

### **Query Examples That Are Filtered**:
