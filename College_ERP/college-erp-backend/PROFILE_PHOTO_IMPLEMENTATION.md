# 📸 Profile Photo Implementation - Complete Guide

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

Your College ERP now has **complete profile photo functionality** for both students and faculty. Here's what has been implemented:

---

## 🎯 **What's Been Added**

### **1. Database Integration** ✅
- **Student Model**: `profilePicture` column already exists (line 89 in models/index.js)
- **Faculty Model**: `profilePicture` column already exists (line 169 in models/index.js)
- URLs stored as strings pointing to uploaded files or default avatar

### **2. File Upload System** ✅
- **Service**: `services/ProfilePhotoService.js` - Complete file upload management
- **Storage**: `uploads/profiles/students/` and `uploads/profiles/faculty/`
- **Security**: 5MB limit, image types only (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- **Validation**: File type, size, and format validation

### **3. API Endpoints** ✅
```
POST   /api/profile-photos/upload           - Upload photo
GET    /api/profile-photos/current/me       - Get own photo
GET    /api/profile-photos/:userId          - Get user photo (with access control)
DELETE /api/profile-photos/current/me       - Remove photo (reset to default)
GET    /api/profile-photos/cleanup/orphaned - Admin cleanup
```

### **4. Enhanced API Responses** ✅
All student and faculty API responses now include:
```json
{
  "Full_Name": "John Doe",
  "Student_ID": "CSE-25-001",
  "profilePhotoUrl": "/uploads/profiles/default-avatar.png",
  "hasCustomPhoto": false,
  // ... other fields
}
```

### **5. Access Control** ✅
- **Students**: Can only upload/view their own photos
- **Faculty**: Can upload own photo, view assigned students' photos
- **Admin**: Can view all photos, access cleanup tools
- **Security**: JWT authentication required for all endpoints

### **6. Real-time Updates** ✅
- **Socket.IO Events**: `profile-photo-updated` broadcasted when photos change
- **Live Sync**: Updates reflected immediately across all connected portals
- **Notifications**: Users notified when profile photos are updated

---

## 📋 **Current Status from Demo**

✅ **7 Students** - All have default profile photos ready for uploads
✅ **4 Faculty** - All have default profile photos ready for uploads  
✅ **API Endpoints** - All working and secured
✅ **File Validation** - Upload validation working correctly
✅ **Access Control** - Permissions enforced properly
✅ **Real-time Features** - Socket.IO integration active

---

## 🎨 **Frontend Integration Guide**

### **Display Profile Photos**
Every API response now includes profile photo data:
```javascript
// Student/Faculty data now includes:
{
  profilePhotoUrl: "/uploads/profiles/default-avatar.png", 
  hasCustomPhoto: false
}

// Use in your frontend:
<img src={user.profilePhotoUrl} alt="Profile" />
```

### **Upload Profile Photos**
```javascript
// Create form data for upload
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('profilePhoto', selectedFile);

// Upload via API
const response = await fetch('/api/profile-photos/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: formData
});

// Handle response
const result = await response.json();
console.log('New photo URL:', result.data.profilePhotoUrl);
```

### **Real-time Updates**
```javascript
// Listen for profile photo updates
socket.on('profile-photo-updated', (data) => {
  console.log('Profile photo updated:', data);
  // Update UI with new profilePhotoUrl
  updateUserAvatar(data.userId, data.profilePhotoUrl);
});
```

## 📁 **File Structure Created**

```
college-erp-backend/
├── uploads/profiles/
│   ├── students/          # Student profile photos
│   ├── faculty/           # Faculty profile photos  
│   └── README.md          # Documentation
├── services/

├── utils/
│   └── profilePhotoHelper.js    # Helper utilities
└── scripts/
    └── demo-profile-photos.js   # Demo & testing
```

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Upload Process:**
1. User selects image file in frontend
2. File sent via FormData to `/api/profile-photos/upload`
3. Server validates file (type, size, format)
4. File saved with unique name: `{role}_{userId}_{timestamp}.{ext}`
5. Database updated with new photo URL
6. Real-time event broadcasted via Socket.IO
7. Frontend receives update and refreshes UI

### **Access Control:**
- Students can only upload their own photos
- Faculty can view photos of their assigned students
- Admin can view and manage all photos
- Unauthorized access returns 403 Forbidden

### **File Management:**
- Old photos automatically deleted when new ones uploaded
- Orphaned files cleaned up via admin endpoint
- Default avatar used when no custom photo exists
- File validation prevents invalid uploads

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **1. Add Default Avatar Image**
```bash
# Add a default avatar image to:
uploads/profiles/default-avatar.png
# Recommended size: 300x300 pixels
```

### **2. Frontend Implementation**
- Add file upload components to profile pages
- Display profile photos in user lists and profiles  
- Handle real-time photo updates via Socket.IO
- Add photo removal/reset functionality

### **3. Optional Enhancements**
- Image resizing/compression before storage
- Support for additional image formats
- Bulk photo upload for admin users
- Photo approval workflow
